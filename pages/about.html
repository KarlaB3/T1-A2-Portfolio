  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>I'm a former marketer and now an aspiring full stack developer, completing the Web Development Bootcamp at Coder Academy.</p>
  <p>Professionally passionate about bringing digital projects to life. Working in client and agency-side marketing has given me the opportunity to develop strategy and project manage website and app builds and gamification for loyalty, rewards and competition apps.</p> 
  <p>The Coder Academy Web Development Bootcamp will enhance my current skillset and allow me to build digital products from the ground up.</p>
  <p>I'm personally passionate about all things tennis, health and wellbeing. I believe in the power of exercise to improve and maintain optimal mental and physical health. Tennis combines my enjoyment of physical activity with the challenges of technique improvement and staying focused. I also enjoy immersing myself in nature, spending outdoor time hiking or at the beach.</p>
